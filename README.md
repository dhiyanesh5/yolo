## Introduction

This project aims to evaluate the performance of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 on a PPE detection dataset. Various training configurations, including epoch increases and hyperparameter tuning, were tested to optimize the models and improve detection accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains labeled images for three PPE components:
- **Helmet**
- **IFR Suit**
- **Boots**

The dataset was split into:
- **Training Set**
- **Validation Set**
- **Testing Set**

## Model Configurations

### YOLOv5
1. **Baseline (50 Epochs):**
   - Standard training with no hyperparameter tuning.
2. **Enhanced (100 Epochs & Hypertuning):**
   - Training extended to 100 epochs with optimized hyperparameters.

### YOLOv8
1. **Baseline (50 Epochs):**
   - Evaluated using YOLOv8â€™s default configuration for comparison with YOLOv5.

## Results

| Metric           | YOLOv5 Baseline (50 Epochs) | YOLOv5 (100 Epochs & Hypertuning) | YOLOv8 Baseline (50 Epochs) |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Precision**     | 0.56689                    | 0.46967                            | 0.4584                     |
| **Recall**        | 0.32576                    | 0.48601                            | 0.6312                     |
| **mAP@0.5**       | 0.17733                    | 0.43785                            | 0.4808                     |
| **mAP@0.5:0.95**  | 0.06062                    | 0.17525                            | 0.2360                     |

### Summary
- **YOLOv5 Baseline:** Showed good precision but lower recall and mAP.
- **YOLOv5 with Improvements:** Enhanced recall and mAP significantly with more epochs and tuning.
- **YOLOv8 Baseline:** Outperformed YOLOv5 in recall and mAP, even in the baseline configuration.

## Key Insights

1. Increasing epochs and applying hyperparameter tuning in YOLOv5 improved recall and mAP scores.
2. YOLOv8 demonstrated superior performance in terms of recall and overall detection accuracy, achieving the highest mAP scores across configurations.
3. YOLOv5 has a slight advantage in precision when using fewer epochs, but this decreases when epochs increase.
